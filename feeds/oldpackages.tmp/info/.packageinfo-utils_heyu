Maintainer: 
Source: heyu-2.9.1.tgz
Type: ipkg
Description: 	HEYU is a text-based console program for remotely controlling lights
	and appliances in the home or office.   It is made available under a
	free and open source license.

	Heyu uses the CM11A computer interface to send and receive X10 control
	signals over the AC power lines to modules which can turn On, Off, or
	Dim attached lamps or appliances.   It can store a schedule of timed
	events in the CM11A memory for execution when the computer is turned
	off or disconnected.
