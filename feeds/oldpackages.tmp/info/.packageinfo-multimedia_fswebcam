Description:   fswebcam is a neat and simple webcam app. It captures images from a V4L1/V4L2 compatible
  device or file, averages them to reduce noise and draws a caption using the GD Graphics
  Library which also handles compressing the image to PNG or JPEG. The resulting image
  is saved to a file or sent to stdio where it can be piped to something like ncftpput or scp.
