Type: ipkg
Description: mksh is the MirBSD enhanced version of the Public Domain Korn
shell (pdksh), a Bourne-compatible shell which is largely si-
milar to the original AT&T Korn shell; mksh is the only pdksh
derivate currently being actively developed.  It includes bug
fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a modern,
robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.
mksh has UTF-8 support (in substring operations and the Emacs
editing mode) and - while R47 corresponds to OpenBSD 5.1-cur-
rent ksh (without GNU bash-like PS1 and fancy character clas-
ses) - adheres to SUSv4 and is much more robust. The code has
been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed, standards compli-
ance added, and several enhancements (for extended compatibi-
lity to other modern shells - as well as a couple of its own)
are available. It has sensible defaults as usual with BSD.
