Title: micro anycast tunneling daemon
Maintainer: Christian Pointner <equinox@anytun.org>
Source: uanytun-0.3.3.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:   uAnytun is a tiny implementation of SATP the secure anycast tunneling protocol.
  SATP defines a protocol used for communication between any combination of
  unicast and anycast tunnel endpoints.  It has less protocol overhead than
  IPSec in Tunnel mode and allows tunneling of every ETHER TYPE protocol (e.g.
  ethernet, ip, arp ...). SATP directly includes cryptography and message
  authentication based on the methodes used by SRTP.  It is intended to deliver
  a generic, scaleable and secure solution for tunneling and relaying of packets
  of any protocol.
  Unlike Anytun which is a full featured implementation uAnytun has no support
  for multiple connections or synchronisation. It is a small single threaded
  implementation intended to act as a client on small platforms.
