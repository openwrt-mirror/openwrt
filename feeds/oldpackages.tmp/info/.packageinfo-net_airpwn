Type: ipkg
Description:   Airpwn is a framework for 802.11 (wireless) packet injection.
  Airpwn listens to incoming wireless packets, and if the data
  matches a pattern specified in the config files, custom content
  is injected "spoofed" from the wireless access point. From the
  perspective of the wireless client, airpwn becomes the server.
