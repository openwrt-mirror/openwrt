Title: A daemon working like Cisco(c) HSRP
Maintainer: 
Source: vgp-0.2.1.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description: 	VGP (Virtual Gateway Protocol)is a very simple protocol able to
	work in a way similar to Cisco(c) HSRP. It implements the idea
	of Virtual Gateway to provide fault tollerance (and load
	balancing) on your net. Each client on your net has as its
	default gateway set to the virtual gateway and not the real router.
