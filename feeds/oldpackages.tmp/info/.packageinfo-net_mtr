Type: ipkg
Description: 	mtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs
	in a single network diagnostic tool.
	As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host
	mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host. After it
	determines the address of each network hop between the machines,
	it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the
	quality of the link to each machine. As it does this, it prints
	running statistics about each machine.
