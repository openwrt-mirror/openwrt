Description:  The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your
 Python interpreter.
 .
 This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient
 internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing
 capabilities.

 The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a
 few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a
 general image processing tool.
