Title: OWFS - fuse file system
Maintainer: Jo-Philipp Wich <jow@openwrt.org>
Source: owfs-2.9p5.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:     OWFS is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its
  devices easily accessible. The underlying priciple is to create a virtual
  filesystem, with the unique ID being the directory, and the individual
  properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read
  and written.

  Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a
  consistent interface. The goal is to provide an easy set of tools for a
  software designer to create monitoring or control applications. There are
  some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching,
  parallel access to bus masters, and aggregation of device communication.
  Still the fundemental goal has been ease of use, flexibility and correctness
  rather than speed.

  This package contains the OWFS fuse filesystem.
