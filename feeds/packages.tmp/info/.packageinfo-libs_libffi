Title: Foreign Function Interface (FFI) library
Maintainer: Peter Wagner <tripolar@gmx.at>
Source: libffi-3.0.13.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description: The libffi library provides a portable, high level programming interface to
various calling conventions. This allows a programmer to call any function
specified by a call interface description at run-time.

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface. A foreign function interface is the
popular name for the interface that allows code written in one language to call
code written in another language. The libffi library really only provides the
lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.
A layer must exist above libffi that handles type conversions for values passed
between the two languages.
