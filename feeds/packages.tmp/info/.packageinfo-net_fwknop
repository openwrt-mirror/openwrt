Title: FireWall KNock OPerator Daemon
Maintainer: Jonathan Bennett <JBennett@incomsystems.biz>
Source: fwknop-2.6.2.tar.bz2
Type: ipkg
Description:     Fwknop implements an authorization scheme known as Single Packet Authorization
  (SPA) for Linux systems running iptables.  This mechanism requires only a
  single encrypted and non-replayed packet to communicate various pieces of
  information including desired access through an iptables policy. The main
  application of this program is to use iptables in a default-drop stance to
  protect services such as SSH with an additional layer of security in order to
  make the exploitation of vulnerabilities (both 0-day and unpatched code) much
  more difficult.
  This package contains the fwknop daemon.
