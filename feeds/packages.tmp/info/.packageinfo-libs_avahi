Title: An mDNS/DNS-SD implementation (libavahi-client library)
Maintainer: Ted Hess <thess@kitschensync.net>
Source: avahi-0.6.31.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:  Avahi is an mDNS/DNS-SD (aka RendezVous/Bonjour/ZeroConf)
 implementation (library). It facilitates
 service discovery on a local network -- this means that
 you can plug your laptop or computer into a network and
 instantly be able to view other people who you can chat with,
 find printers to print to or find files being shared.
 This kind of technology is already found in MacOS X
 (branded 'Rendezvous', 'Bonjour' and sometimes 'ZeroConf')
 and is very convenient.
 .
 This packages adds the libavahi-client library.
 It also automatically adds the required
 libavahi-dbus-support and the avahi-daemon packages.
 For more information please see the avahi documentation.

Title: An mDNS/DNS-SD implementation (D-Bus support)
Maintainer: Ted Hess <thess@kitschensync.net>
Source: avahi-0.6.31.tar.gz
Type: ipkg

 implementation (library). It facilitates
 service discovery on a local network -- this means that

 .
 The libavahi package contains the mDNS/DNS-SD shared libraries,
 used by other programs. Specifically, it provides
 libavahi-core and libavahi-common libraries.
 By default, it is built without D-Bus support,
 i.e. the --disable-dbus configuration flag is set.
 To enable D-Bus support, select the package
 libavahi-dbus-support.
 .
 The libavahi-dbus-support package enables
 D-Bus support in avahi, needed to support
 the libavahi-client library and avahi-utils.
 Selecting this package modifies the build configuration
 so that avahi packages are built with support for D-BUS enabled;
 it does not generate a separate binary of its own.
 It also automatically adds the D-Bus package to the build.
 libavahi-dbus-support is selected automatically if you select
 libavahi-client or avahi-utils.

 This package implements IPv4LL, "Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local
 Addresses" (IETF RFC3927), a protocol for automatic IP address configuration
 from the link-local 169.254.0.0/16 range without the need for a central
 server. It is primarily intended to be used in ad-hoc networks which lack a
 DHCP server.
