Title: execute commands when a key is pressed, released or hold down
Maintainer: Ted Hess <thess@kitschensync.net>
Source: cmdpad-0.0.3.tgz
Type: ipkg
Description: 	cmdpad - execute commands when a key is pressed, released or hold down.
	Should be started from /etc/rc or /etc/rc.local. To run it as deamon you
	need to start it with '&'. All logs are printed to standard out and standard
	error (to write the log to disk use cmdpad > /var/log/cmdpad). Cmdpad
	searches for /etc/cmdpad.conf and load the key bindings. Then wait for
	key event and check each command to see if it should be run.
